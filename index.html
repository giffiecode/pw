      <p class='intro'>Hello, I'm <strong>Nico</strong>.<br /> 

     <br /> I'm a learner and builder from Shanghai living in the US. <br />

 <br /> Currently tinkering on the frontier of crypto applications through building <a href="https://www.skylabhq.io/"><b>Sky Lab</b></a> - a fully on-chain casual game company building games that can only be realized on-chain. I see a future where game creation is democratized just as how social media democratizes media, with user-generated games, open economy, and novel in-game social dynamics flourishing on-chain. Sky Lab is backed by a16z and others.<br />

<br /> I'm interested in universal money access and building products that make crypto easier and useful for people who need it. <br /> 

<br /> In my spare time, I'm drawn to bridge, strategy board games, poker & chess. I love to read non-fictions, take photos, snowboard, and play tennis. <br /> 

<br /> If things resonate with you, happy to connect and chat! My email is nicopei321@gmail.com and <a href="https://twitter.com/sillyduckety">twitter</a> DM is open.<br />

<br /> Once upon a time, I did some modeling (in fashion, not on excel) <br />
